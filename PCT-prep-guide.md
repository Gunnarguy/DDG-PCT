# Burney Falls ➜ Castle Crags Prep Guide

_Compiled from Original-DDG-PCT narrative notes + supporting resources_

---

## 1. Executive Snapshot

- **Primary window:** Sat **29 Aug** → Sun **6 Sep** (Labor Day homecoming)
- **Alternate detox window:** Sat **22 Aug** → Sun **6 Sep** (16 days, slower & more restorative)
- **Mileage focus:** 52 mi (Burney Falls → Castle Crags, 6-day plan) with 8–10 mi/day pacing. Full Section O to Dunsmuir is 82.9 mi.
- **Team plan:** Gunnar drives, scoops everyone at Sacramento (SMF), stages car near Burney Falls, and arranges shuttle/Uber back from Castle Crags.
- **Support roles:** Mom coordinates parallel women’s adventures; budget sharing limited, so keep plans cash-aware.

## 2. Schedule Options & Decision Matrix

| Option | Pros | Trade-offs | Decision Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **9-Day Express** (Aug 29–Sep 6) | Aligns with long-weekend return; minimal PTO; matches narrative itinerary | Tighter buffer for weather, wildfire, or zero-days | Preferred baseline; finalize over Thanksgiving talk |
| **16-Day Detox** (Aug 22–Sep 6) | Mirrors Drew’s April detox run; adds side trips & recovery nights | More PTO + financing; Gunnar must juggle logotherapy conference | Keep on the table until group sync; beneficial for true unplugging |

> **Action:** Bring both options to Thanksgiving planning session with open minds before locking flights or PTO.

## 3. Day-by-Day Trail Plan (Burney Falls → Castle Crags)

⚠️ **CRITICAL ELEVATION CORRECTION:** Dad's original PDF underestimated elevations by 500-1,700 feet. The table below shows GPS-calculated reality. You'll be hiking at **5,000-5,600 ft** for most of the trip (Days 2-5), NOT the 3,500-4,800 ft range in the PDF. Plan for higher altitude effects.

| Day | Segment | Dist. | Start → End Elev. | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Burney Falls SP → Round Valley CG | ~10 mi | 3,020' → 3,765' | Waterfall send-off, moderate climb (+1,389' gain), peaceful camp |
| 2 | Round Valley → Black Rock Camp | ~9 mi | 3,765' → 5,425' | Forested rolling terrain (+1,960' gain), well-known campsite |
| 3 | Black Rock → Horse Camp | ~8 mi | 5,425' → 5,297' | Scenic woods, mild descent (-128' net), Horse Camp PCT staple |
| 4 | Horse Camp → Indian Springs | ~9 mi | 5,297' → 5,605' | Springs + reliable water, moderate climb (+1,304' gain) |
| 5 | Indian Springs → Castle Crags Vista | ~8 mi | 5,605' → 5,642' | Vista views of Crags & Mt. Shasta, minimal elevation change |
| 6 | Castle Crags Vista → Castle Crags SP | ~8 mi | 5,642' → 3,083' | Long descent (-2,552' loss), knees beware, State Park finish |
| 7–9 (flex) | Side trips / zeros | variable | — | Use for Dunsmuir resupply, Mt. Shasta visit, or scenic layovers |

> **Mapping tools:** Guthook/FarOut, OnX Maps, NST Guide map viewer (this repo’s `pct-hike-viz`).

## 4. Travel & Shuttle Logistics

- **Inbound:**
  - Fly to **Sacramento (SMF)** Friday night / early Saturday.
  - Gunnar drives 4 hrs to Burney Falls trailhead; stage car there.
- **Trailhead staging:** Confirm overnight parking rules with Burney Falls SP.
- **Outbound:**
  - Finish at **Castle Crags State Park**.
  - Arrange shuttle/Uber/Trail Angel or **STAGE Bus** → Dunsmuir/Mt. Shasta → retrieve car.
  - Backup: **Mt. Shasta Taxi +1 530-605-7950**; hitching viable but plan formal rides first.
- **Parallel trips:** Coordinate with Mom for the women’s adventure (financially limited support from “manboys”).

## 5. Resupply & Town Day (Dunsmuir, CA)

- **Why Dunsmuir?** 10–15 mi south of Castle Crags; best mid-hike zero.
- **Access:** Exit via Soda Creek Rd or Castle Crags lot → STAGE Bus / taxi.
- **Amenities:** Full groceries, dining, lodging, gear, laundry. Mt. Shasta (15 mi north) for larger resupply.
- **Transit:**
  - **STAGE bus** (seasonal; pre-book).
  - **Amtrak Coast Starlight** station in Dunsmuir for emergency egress.
  - Private shuttles & taxi network.
- **Plan:** Pre-arrange rides two weeks ahead (Labor Day demand is high). Keep a list of Trail Angel contacts.
