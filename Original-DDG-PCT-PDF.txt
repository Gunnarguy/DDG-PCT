GunDrew,
I have a number of AI searches in this narrative that you can search, or not, as you have
time in order to help make this a better organized hike.
I chose this area because it is a combination of the nicest views with less of the really nasty
elevation hiking which kills you (correction: killed ME). You guys feel free to look at other
areas. I have books, maps and articles to support the choice that I made, but I am famous
for the blindness I experience in the rabbit holes I run down so I need you two to keep me in
check and make sure I looked at everything.
Right at the moment, I am looking at us being on the trail, hiking, with the first day being
Saturday, August 29th, and the last day being Sunday, September 6th. This way, we can
spend our Labor Day at home, nursing our blisters with the salve of our memories and our
many unforgettable triumphs.
Now, with that said, Drew and I went from April 12th to April 28th, which was 16 days. Do we
want to do that again? CAN we do that, affordably (take the time off of work)? This is a
question for us all to ponder and talk about when we get together. I would recommend
caution against making our minds up definitively before we all arrive and talk about this
with open minds when we meet over Thanksgiving because the two weeks that Drew and I
spent really had the effect of detoxifying us from external news, social media, and the
effects of a crazy world out there. It was something I never suspected would happen, but it
was wonderful, so let’s consider it before we just discount it.
If we did that, because of my schedule and a worldwide conference in Logotherapy that I
am hosting as the President, I would have to start on August 22nd instead of August 29th. But
at the moment we are talking about 9 days going from August 29th through September 6th
.
Either way, I am going to suggest that Gunnar drive and pick us both (Drew and I) up at
Sacramento airport so we can drive the additional 4 hours to our starting point. Then he can
park, and we will have to uber back to the car when we are done (all of this will have to be
arranged beforehand through Shuttle Drivers or Trail Angels – Drew and I used these on the
Adirondack Trail several times. There are a lot of them).
I know mom is planning on asking the women in our lives into an adventure of their own. If
we go the full 16 days, it won’t be that long but it will involve some really cool stuff she is
cooking up. We can help a little on the finance but we cannot bankroll the whole thing, we
just don’t have it, so I know there will be some decisions made on cashflow as far as the
boy/girl trip thing is concerned but you two shouldn’t worry about it as far as we manboys
are concerned.
Here is a potential breakdown of a 90-100 mile segment of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from
Burney Falls to Castle Crags State Park with daily hikes of about 10 miles or less, named
camping sites, and starting and ending elevations for each day and this would be only for a
one week excursion. A two weeker would just involve more sidetrips and maybe a stayover
or two (it would be much more relaxing):
Pacific Crest Trail Segment: Burney Falls to Castle Crags State Park (Approx. 78-90
miles)
Day 1: Burney Falls State Park to Round Valley Campground
• Distance: ~10 miles
• Start Elevation: ~2,300 ft (Burney Falls)
• End Elevation: ~3,200 ft (Round Valley Campground)
• Features: Start in Burney Falls with access to waterfalls, moderate elevation gain,
peaceful campsite.
Day 2: Round Valley Campground to Black Rock Camp
• Distance: ~9 miles
• Start Elevation: ~3,200 ft
• End Elevation: ~3,650 ft
• Features: Forested trail with mild elevation gain, well-known wilderness campsite.
Day 3: Black Rock Camp to Horse Camp
• Distance: ~8 miles
• Start Elevation: ~3,650 ft
• End Elevation: ~4,000 ft
• Features: Scenic wooded trail, Horse Camp is a popular PCT camping spot.
Day 4: Horse Camp to Indian Springs Camp
• Distance: ~9 miles
• Start Elevation: ~4,000 ft
• End Elevation: ~4,800 ft
• Features: Small springs and water source, moderate climb.
Day 5: Indian Springs Camp to Castle Crags Vista Camp
• Distance: ~8 miles
• Start Elevation: ~4,800 ft
• End Elevation: ~5,850 ft
• Features: Vista camp with views of Castle Crags and Mt. Shasta, good spot for
camping.
Day 6: Castle Crags Vista Camp to Castle Crags State Park
• Distance: ~8 miles
• Start Elevation: ~5,850 ft
• End Elevation: ~3,600 ft (Castle Crags State Park)
• Features: Descend toward Castle Crags State Park; opportunity to resupply and
rest.
This itinerary emphasizes 8-10 mile hiking days suitable for someone not in great shape and
includes key campsites known for water availability and scenic beauty. Elevation varies
moderately each day with mostly gradual climbs and descents, allowing for a manageable
pace with spectacular views of waterfalls, Castle Crags, and Mt. Shasta along the route.
For more precise mile markers and elevation profiles, topographic maps or GPS apps like
Guthook or onXMaps tailored to the PCT section can be helpful.wildernessvagabond+3

A logical point for a side trip to a larger town for restocking between Burney Falls and Castle
Crags State Park on the Pacific Crest Trail is:
Town: Dunsmuir, CA
• Approximately 10-15 miles south of Castle Crags State Park, accessible via Soda
Creek Road trail exit near the PCT
• Larger town with grocery stores, restaurants, lodging, and outdoor gear shops
• Also close to Mt. Shasta (about 15 miles north of Dunsmuir) for additional resupply
options and services
How to Get There and Back:
• Transportation from Castle Crags to Dunsmuir:
o The STAGE Bus offers shuttle service from Castle Crags State Park area to
Dunsmuir and Mt. Shasta (service subject to seasonal schedules; usually
requires advance contact or reservation)
o Private shuttles and taxis available, such as Mt. Shasta Taxi (+1 530-605-
7950 or local providers), which can be pre-arranged by phone for pick-up and
drop-off
o Hitchhiking is possible on the nearby roads; trail users sometimes share
rides
• Public Transit and Train Access:
o Dunsmuir is on the AMTRAK Coast Starlight line, making it accessible by train
if coming from farther away
o Local bus services exist but are limited; advance planning is recommended
Additional Notes:
• Burney Falls is more remote with fewer public transport options, so side trips for full
resupply usually happen near Castle Crags or Dunsmuir area
• Scheduling shuttles or taxi rides in advance is advised, especially during busy or off-
season times
• It's useful to contact local visitor centers or the Castle Crags State Park office for
updated transportation info and shuttle availability before planning the side trip
This setup offers the best practical option to break the hike between Burney Falls and
Castle Crags for resupply with reliable transportation links.pcta+5

For overnight camping on the Pacific Crest Trail between Burney Falls and Castle Crags
State Park, the following permits and considerations apply:
Permits Required
• General Overnight Camping Permits:
In Northern California, overnight camping permits along the PCT are generally
required but are non-quota and free. These permits are typically self-issued,
available at local Forest Service offices such as those in Weaverville, Fort Jones, or
nearby ranger stations. For the Castle Crags Wilderness area, no special wilderness
permit is required for overnight camping.
• Castle Crags State Park:
Camping within the State Park itself is limited to designated campgrounds where a
campground fee and registration may be required. Backcountry camping is
allowed in the adjacent Castle Crags Wilderness but not inside the state park
boundaries.
• California Campfire Permit:
If planning to use a stove or campfire along the PCT in California, a California
Campfire Permit is required. This permit is free, valid for one calendar year, and can
be obtained online after watching a brief video and passing a quiz.
Summary
• Self-issued free overnight camping permits at ranger stations or visitor centers
cover dispersed camping on the PCT segment between Burney Falls and Castle
Crags.
• Designated campground camping inside Castle Crags State Park requires
registration and fees.
• A California Campfire Permit is required for using any open flame or stove.
These permit requirements make it fairly straightforward to camp overnight, but hikers
should obtain the appropriate permits in advance or at local offices and follow all
regulations to protect natural resources.pcta+5
