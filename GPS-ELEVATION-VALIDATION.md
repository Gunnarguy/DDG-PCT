# GPS Elevation Validation Report

## Executive Summary
**GPS elevation data is scientifically accurate** with an average error of **0.4%** compared to USGS National Map authoritative data.

## Validation Methodology
- **Source**: USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) via National Map Elevation Point Query Service
- **Authority**: Official US Government topographic elevation data
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Waypoints Tested**: 5 key locations spanning entire route

## Validation Results

| Location | GPS Elevation | USGS Elevation | Difference | % Error | Status |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------|--------|
| Burney Falls Trailhead | 3,020 ft | 3,014 ft | +6 ft | 0.2% | ✓ Excellent |
| Round Valley Camp | 3,765 ft | 3,732 ft | +33 ft | 0.9% | ✓ Excellent |
| Black Rock Camp | 5,425 ft | 5,416 ft | +9 ft | 0.2% | ✓ Excellent |
| Horse Camp | 5,297 ft | 5,284 ft | +13 ft | 0.2% | ✓ Excellent |
| Indian Springs Camp | 5,605 ft | 5,624 ft | -19 ft | 0.3% | ✓ Excellent |

**Average Error**: 0.4% (16 feet across 5 waypoints)  
**Maximum Error**: 0.9% (33 feet at Round Valley)

## Conclusion
The Garmin GPS elevation data is **highly accurate** and suitable for trip planning. All waypoints validate within 1% of USGS authoritative elevations, which is exceptional for consumer GPS devices.

### Comparison to Original PDF Estimates

| Waypoint | PDF Est. | GPS/USGS | Underestimate |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Start | 2,300 ft | 3,020 ft | **720 ft (31%)** |
| Mid-route | 3,500-4,800 ft | 5,000-5,600 ft | **500-1,500 ft (14-31%)** |

**Trip Impact**: Dad's PDF systematically underestimated elevations by 500-1,500 feet. The GPS-calculated values (now verified by USGS) provide accurate altitude data for:
- Conditioning preparation
- Altitude acclimatization planning  
- Weather/temperature expectations
- Water boiling times
- Physical exertion estimates

## Recommendation
**Use GPS elevations for all trip planning.** They are scientifically validated and far more accurate than the PDF estimates.
