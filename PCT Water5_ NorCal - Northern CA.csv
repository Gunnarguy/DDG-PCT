"Never rely on water caches!!! Beware of contaminated water. Purify backcountry water.
FOR WATER CACHE TRAIL ANGELS : Water jugs, and caches, left unattended often end up as litter blown across the landscape. A little rope through the handles is a quick fix (if there is no other way to secure the bottles) but don't forget to revisit what you've left out! If you are going to put items out on trail please keep Leave No Trace principles in mind to preserve our trails.",,,,,,
"All updates will remain on this report for 12 months. A representative sample of older updates will remain to provide context for water availability in previous years. You can send email updates to pctwater@gmail.com or phone/text 619-734-7289 or 619-734-PCTW [voice mail/text only, no one will answer]. Waypoint IDs used in this water report are derived from Halfmile’s PCT maps which stopped receiving updates in 2019, as well as official PCTA IDs when available. Mileages were updated in 2025 using official PCTA mileage data. Please post photos & videos of water sources, fires, passes, Poodle Dog Bush, and stream creek crossings to our Facebook Group, PCT Water,Fire,Passes,Fords Update Group",,,,,,
Take fire safety seriously. Alcohol stoves start fires – go stoveless or carry a stove with a contained fuel source and a shut-off valve.,,,,,,
"Water sources with blue text [marked with  * or **] have historically been more reliable. Sources marked with ** are more likely to have water year-round than those marked with a single *. Water described as seasonal, usually dry, early spring, etc. are less reliable.",,,,,,

"6/1/16 (Fat Sectioner) : Currently, Carter Creek is at the point where the trail crosses Carter creek, 350 feet or so past the campsites.  If one follows the path past that, it crosses another (unnamed) creek that will later join Carter creek and have a much more substantial combined flow. To put that in a mileage log format: 
     * 0.0 miles: Leave PCT
     * 0.4 miles: Campsite
     * 0.45 miles: Carter Creek Crossing
     * 0.5 miles: Unnamed Creek Crossing
     * 0.6 miles: Confluence of two creeks 100 feet to the west of the trail
     * 0.7 miles: Permanent (aka more than seasonal) creek about 50 feet to the west of the trail
     *** To that end, at the Carter Meadows trail intersection on the PCT there's a sign that says ""permanent water 0.7 mi"".  And based on what I've seen, that makes a lot of sense. However, the campsites are similar enough distance, one could easily assume that was the  0.7 miles (particularly with how off mileage can be on trail markers) and not explore further down-stream. So what I'd recommend is adding waypoint WA1316 at location 40.2027,-121.4178 (that's the 0.6 mile item on the mileage log) with the description: ""Permanent water on Carter Creek, further downstream of campsite.""  If you'd prefer something even more substantial, you could use location40.2042,-121,4166 that is 0.7miles downstream.  At that point the flow is so strong the creek can be seen from Google Earth imagery and the USGS topo maps show another creek having joined in (although I didn't see it).",,,,,,
